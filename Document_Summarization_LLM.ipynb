Introduction\\n\\n\\nThe police-involved deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and other Black Americans led many to critically reappraise the role of police in society. These focusing events gave rise to widespread calls for reforms to diminish systemic racism and the role of law enforcement in American society by reducing local police budgets and reallocating those resources toward civilian agencies (Lum, Koper, &amp; Wu 2022). Amid increased attention to violent crime nationally (Brennan 2022; Goodman 2021), policymakers seek reforms to shift police resources toward crime control and prevention (Parker &amp; Hurst 2021).\\n\\nEmpirical evidence supports both sides of this duality by demonstrating that expanded police presence (supported by increased spending) can reduce crime while also amplifying tension between communities of color and police. This conundrum speaks to the pressing need to understand the implications of police spending as well as how police budgets and resources are allocated. Recent analyses suggest U.S. cities consistently under-invest in policing relative to the crime-reducing potential of additional police (Chalfin &amp; McCrary 2018). There are also considerably fewer U.S. police officers per homicide compared to other high- and mediumincome countries (Lewis &amp; Usmani 2022). Mello (2019) estimates the marginal social benefit of hiring an additional police officer exceeds $300,000 annually. While there may be tangible benefits to crime control associated with investing in police, the actions of police officers can also impose harm on communities, especially predominantly Black communities (Soss &amp; Weaver, 2017). For example, police are more likely to use force in interactions with Blacks than with whites (Edwards, Esposito, &amp; Lee 2019; Fryer 2019; Knox, Lowe, &amp; Mummolo 2020; Hoekstra &amp; Sloan 2022). Black residents also report less satisfaction with police, more legal cynicism, and are more likely to believe that police act unjustly (Hagan et al., 2005; Pickett et al., 2021; Sampson &amp; Bartusch, 1998; Weitzer et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2009).\\n\\nOne potential pathway to reducing harm associated with police presence while preserving or even enhancing public safety is to limit unnecessary interactions between police and community members by diverting certain calls for service to civilian responders.  From this 1 perspective, re-tasking police emergency service calls that are outside the scope of crime control and prevention (that is, do not require an armed law enforcement officer with broad coercive\\n\\npowers) to civilian agencies should reduce police misuse of force in the United States. Indeed, the presence of an armed officer can worsen some situations; individuals with behavioral health problems may see armed officer as a threat, not a source of security.\\n\\nReforms to emergency responses could yield other benefits. For example, they have the potential to free police officer time to focus on serious crime which may also yield improvements with community satisfaction in police. In fact, recent studies estimate that 40 to 70 percent of community-initiated emergency calls for service do not involve a criminal incident (Brantingham &amp; Uchida 2021; Lum, Koper, &amp; Wu 2022; Neusteter et al. 2020; Ratcliffe 2021). Further, given that police officers may be costlier to deploy than other first responders, efficiency gains may accrue where calls for service are unlikely to require police presence. These funds could be diverted to other community agencies or services that could 'step in' to respond to nonemergency situations.\\n\\nIn this study we consider the viability of re-tasking a subset of police emergency calls to civilian first responders in Baltimore, Maryland. We then identify the implications of retasking using two related measures: police time use and the financial cost of police. We estimate both outcomes using Monte Carlo simulation methods to account for uncertainty in the components of the call dispatch and response process. Our approach is based on the police service costing method proposed by Ellingwood (2016) that assigns the financial cost of each emergency call for service based on time use reported by officers and the wages of uniformed officers or civilian responders such as an Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) or social workers. The baseline analysis shows that calls that are already re-tasked by several 'early adopter' municipalities could be resolved by civilian responders while freeing the equivalent of 59 officers' labor time annually (95% confidence interval: 43 - 75 officers) in Baltimore with minimal impact on public safety expenditure. The middle estimate represents about 9 percent of the Department's current patrol officers.\\n\\nOur findings build on prior work by investigating the relative risks and costs of emergency public safety response in a major U.S. city. This paper is also the first to present a model to evaluate the time use and fiscal consequences of program design alternatives for 911 call diversion to civilian first responders. We demonstrate that the model can be adapted to varying re-tasking regimes to suit jurisdictions' varying conditions and preferences. Based on administrative data from Baltimore, we further show that the calls diverted in existing programs\\n\\noperated by other large U.S. cities are conservative in terms of risk of serious crime, but relatively lax in terms of patrol officers' perceived need for police response. However, the underlying purpose of this paper is to provide a data-driven model through which re-tasking decisions can be evaluated, not to prescribe which calls should be re-tasked.\\n\\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews relevant literature on civil-police relations, dispatching, and police retasking. Section 3 describes qualitative data obtained through interviews with and on-site observation of three large urban police jurisdictions that adopted 911 call diversion programs. Section 4 summarizes the data and methods used to evaluate the risk of emergency calls for service and the potential for transition. Section 5 reports the findings of this analysis. Section 6 concludes with a discussion of the implications of these results for Baltimore and U.S. cities broadly.\\n\\n\\n## 2. Background\\n\\n\\nThe deaths of many Black Americans in police custody inspired a wave of mass protests in the summer of 2020. A subset of these protesters demanded local governments 'defund' their police departments. These calls quickly grew to a broader set of criticisms about the role of police in American society encompassing their responsibilities, practices, and funding. This section assesses relevant literature on police funding, force size, crime, and civil-police relations with minority communities. Social upheaval and calls for reform provide a window of opportunity for police reforms aimed at reducing the role of police in non-criminal emergency events. These reforms have the potential to decrease the incidence of police violence while freeing police resources that could be reallocated to crime control or other priorities.\\n\\nSeveral studies find race is an important correlate of municipal police spending and that police forces grow with the proportion of the minority population in the community (Holmes et al. 2008; McCarty, Ren, &amp; Zhao 2012). Notably, McCarty et al. (2012) show police strength as measured by budgetary resources is strongly positively related to the share of African American residents in a municipality and weakly to the crime rate. Beck and Goldstein (2018) find that police budgets grew in recent decades even as crime declined because municipalities increasingly rely on police to address social problems in lieu of traditional social service providers.\\n\\nA growing academic literature considers the intersection of policing and race. Owens (2020) notes that extant literature that estimates the benefits of police in reducing crime or the fiscal cost of criminal justice administration has largely ignored 'the impact that police actions can have on the legitimacy of law enforcement and credibility of the state as a benevolent social planner' (p. 11). Recent empirical evidence by Chalfin et al. (2022) recognizes the differential impact of policing among racial groups within a community. They find additional police deter homicides and that the benefit is twice as large for Black Americans compared to whites. However, additional police also means more arrests for minor offenses, and these arrests disproportionately fall on Black Americans without any clear benefit in terms of reduction in criminal harms.  Further, Knox et al. (2020) and Hoekstra and Sloan (2022) separately find 2 Black and Latine people are more likely to experience force than whites during police encounters in studies of large U.S. cities.  Police use of force incidents can also have a chilling effect on 3 public safety and other social outcomes. For example, Cheng and Long (2022) find that highly publicized police killings reduced subsequent proactive policing activities and arrests in several U.S. cities between 2014 and 2016. On the other hand, Moyer (2021) finds community-initiated emergency calls for service in Baltimore were not impacted by the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody in 2015. Several studies suggest that loss of trust in police can reduce the willingness to report crimes (Rosenfeld et al. 2003, Carr et al. 2007, Slocum et al 2010, Tyler &amp; Fagan 2008), though some other papers do not find evidence of this relationship (Frank et al. 1996, Davis &amp; Henderson 2003).\\n\\nA new literature emphasizes the role of emergency communication centers in shaping police interactions, including those with the potential to result in use of force.  Lum et al. (2020) 4 finds that emergency calltakers resolve a substantial percentage of calls for service without direct police involvement. However, call centers are typically required to dispatch police if certain conditions are met, and about half of non-violent calls reviewed by Lum et al. (2020) received a police dispatch. Gillooly (2020) shows that calltakers' risk appraisals prime responding officers' responses to incidents. Other research suggests that calltakers and dispatchers are often poorly\\n\\nequipped to make these assessments. For example, the Pew Charitable Trusts (2021) found less than half of emergency communication centers provided behavioral health crisis training to identify high priority calls. The emerging research suggests successful re-tasking efforts require calltakers and dispatchers to accurately identify calls for service that may be resolved by civilians. It also raises the possibility that certain emergency calls may be systematically misidentified as eligible for a civilian response when police are required. We address this concern in our empirical analysis.\\n\\nIn summary, the extant academic literature reaches remarkable and problematic conclusions about policing, crime, and race. Police funding is associated with the racial composition of a municipality, and thus marginalized communities are more heavily policed than predominately white communities even if the underlying crime rates are comparable. The evidence of the direct effects and externalities of intensive policing is mixed, with recent studies suggesting that it delivers some benefits but also disproportionate costs to Black residents. Owens (2020) argues over-policing of these communities damages the legitimacy of the police, and, in turn, may erode legal compliance in the community (Papachristos, Meares, &amp; Fagan 2012; Tyler, Jackson, &amp; Mantovich 2015).\\n\\nAdvocates of police reform argue that transitioning police service calls to civilian responders can simultaneously rebuild civil-police relations and reduce crime. There is some preliminary evidence this may be the case; Dee and Pyne (2022) find that a novel civilian response pilot program for mental health and substance abuse calls in Denver reduced reports of other criminal activity, including in the hours that the program was not in operation. We build on prior work by defining a model to systematically evaluate emergency events for retasking to civilians that incorporates the empirical data on crime risk and costs, and by incorporating uncertainty in these calculations.\\n\\n\\n## 3. Emergency Call Diversion in Large U.S. Cities\\n\\n\\nWe performed site visits to active programs in three large U.S. cities: the Albuquerque Community Safety (ACS) department in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the Policing Alternatives and Diversion (PAD) initiative in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Crisis Call Diversion (CCD) and Mobile Crisis Outreach Team (MCOT) programs in Houston, TX. In each jurisdiction, we interviewed between eight and twelve stakeholders, including program administrators, police,\\n\\ncall-takers, and civilian first responders, community advocates that are familiar with the origin and purpose of the diversion programs. We observed each program in the field by riding along with civilian first responders in late-2022 and early-2023. We also collected and evaluated administrative documents and publicly available reports.\\n\\nThe ACS, PAD, and CCD/MCOT programs were all developed to reduce police patrol officer workloads, limit the potential for dangerous and unnecessary use of force incidents, and to reduce call volume by matching those in need to social services.  Other design elements vary 5 in ways that are important but less germane to the present study. Atlanta's PAD is a city-funded non-profit borne from public decarceration activism. Houston's CCD and MCOT programs are partnerships that build on prior successful collaborations between the Houston Police and Fire departments and the Harris Center, a county mental health agency. These retasking efforts predate the police reform movement that stemmed from the 2020 Black Lives Matter mass protests. Albuquerque's ACS was formed in 2021 as a municipal agency parallel to the police and fire departments to address provisions of a 2014 consent decree stemming from evidence of systemic excessive use of force. Tensions exist between police and the community in both Atlanta and Albuquerque due to perceived excessive use of force and overreliance on arrest and incarceration, echoing the sentiments of Baltimore residents.\\n\\nThe programs we observed have notable differences in their operations that help to inform our understanding of call diversion program design. Although the composition of the civilian responder teams varies, each program deployed teams that had expertise in mental health crisis intervention and strong familiarity with available local health and social welfare services to which clients could be referred. Most civilian teams were also equipped to provide basic needs such as hygiene products, bedding, and clean clothes.\\n\\nThe specific incidents to which each program responds also varies, but each targets incident types that were unlikely to involve violence or a weapon and had characteristics that were thought to be better served by civilians with specific technical expertise outside the central tenets of patrol policing. Table 1 lists the call types to which each program responded at the time of the site visits and the analogous call type in Baltimore. Albuquerque Community Safety\\n\\n(ACS) behavioral health and community responders field calls to events involving mental health, substance use, and homelessness issues. In Atlanta, the Policing Alternatives and Diversion Initiative (PAD) responds to indecent exposure calls. The table also includes the Denver's STAR program as another well-known example of an early re-tasking program for which there is evidence of success. In Denver, calls for intoxication, suicidal ideation or suicide attempts, welfare checks (i.e., alerts to respond to concerns for someone's safety), indecent exposure, trespass of an unwanted person, and syringe disposal can be reassigned to STAR (Dee &amp; Pyne, 2022). STAR, ACS, and PAD responders only are sent when there is no apparent threat of violence, acute medical need, or serious criminal activity; otherwise, police are dispatched and may request alternative response if or when the threat to civilian responders is minimized.\\n\\nAcross all three jurisdictions we observed, decisions about which calls would receive a civilian response through one of the diversion programs were constrained by risk aversion. For example, although several stakeholders intimated that the present diversion set is too narrow and the call triage process erred toward dispatching police, law enforcement frequently expressed worries about the potential harms to unarmed civilian first responders. This risk aversion carries over to the broader national discourse on police reform. Many U.S. citizens and policymakers orient their understanding around the notion that 911 callers can expect police response. An official who worked with law enforcement and public health officials in the planning and implementation of Houston's CCD program summarized the public's need for emergency response differently after its first five years of operation: 'People call 911 when they don't know what else to do, not just because they want a uniformed officer.'\\n\\nThe interplay between civilian decisions to call the police, call center and dispatcher decisions, and police discretion on the scene is indeed complex. The vast majority of crime is never reported and civilians call the police for a variety of non-criminal matters, which is why diversionary programs may lead to improvements for police and communities alike. Before we detail our model of re-tasking below, it is important to note the complexity of this discretion which we cannot fully account for in our study. On the one hand, individuals who call the police may report inaccurate information (Reiss, 1971), which could spur a chain of events leading to further misclassification or errors. As noted by Black (1970), crime data is also produced by police officers who respond 'on a case-by-case basis to sanctionable conduct' (p.734). While\\n\\nmost studies analyze police decisions to make an arrest, law enforcement officers also make important decisions about whether to record a crime in the first place, which can be influenced by a range of factors related to the individual, the situation, and the community. For example, Warner (1997) finds that police are less likely to record burglary crimes in neighborhoods that are more disadvantaged, but assault did not show this same variation.\\n\\n\\n## 4. Administrative Data and Methods\\n\\n\\n\\n## 4.1. Study Site\\n\\n\\nThis study considers the feasibility of re-tasking police emergency calls in Baltimore, Maryland. Baltimore is an appealing study site for several reasons. In 2020, the city spent $843 per resident on its police department, ranking first among U.S. cities for which data are publicly available (Holder, Akinnibi, &amp; Cannon 2020). Baltimore also has a history of troubled interactions between police and its Black community. Notably, six Baltimore Police Department (BPD) officers were involved in the April 2015 death of Freddie Gray. Although all six were indicted, none were convicted. Major protests and violence marked the death. In March 2017, nine BPD officers on the Gun Trace Task Force were indicted on racketeering charges alleging at least three years of robbery and extortion from city residents (Fenton 2021). Under a 2017 consent decree, Baltimore now collects and disseminates detailed police performance data necessary to monitor the activities of police officers toward reforms prescribed by the decree. These reforms include revision of dispatch policies to cede crisis intervention responsibilities to specially trained officers, 'With a goal of limiting police involvement in crises where appropriate, calls related to crises that do not necessitate a police response will be sent to other crisis services' (U.S. Department of Justice 2017, pp. 39-40). Beginning in June 2021, Baltimore initiated a small pilot program that authorized dispatchers to route calls related to non-weapon suicidal ideation to a community partner, Baltimore Crisis Response, Inc. (BCRI) without the involvement of BPD officers.  The city hopes to expand the program, but we were unable to find 6 evidence of any other ongoing retasking efforts.\\n\\nLike many U.S. law enforcement agencies, the BPD is experiencing a staffing crisis (International Association of Chiefs of Police 2020). Nationwide, police officer staffing declined\\n\\n3.5 percent between 2020 and 2022 and over five percent of budgeted sworn officer positions are unfilled (Police Executive Research Forum 2022). Baltimore's staffing shortfall is more drastic. As of April 2022, the BPD was 25 percent below its planned patrol officer and sergeant force size (Baltimore Police Department 2022). Many police departments are now considering laxer eligibility requirements to expand the hiring pool to candidates that would otherwise not be qualified to serve (Bureau of Justice Assistance and Office of Community Oriented Policing Services 2023). Another method to reduce the staffing shortfall is to reduce patrol officer responsibilities to policing activities that most directly affect public safety and crime control. In this approach, officer resources expended on core duties increase in proportion to the reduction in secondary responsibilities, such as non-criminal responding to non-criminal behavioral health problems.\\n\\n\\n## 4.2. Baltimore Police Department Administrative Data\\n\\n\\nWe rely on 911 call data made available by the BPD that permit categorization of police responses by the disposition of the call event (e.g. recorded crime, situation abated on site, police not needed). The complete dataset is comprised of about 2.5 million community-initiated calls between July 2014 and June 2020; each year about 400,000 calls are received, more than 1,000 per day. Each record includes the event's location, time stamps marking dispatch and the start and end of investigation, and the criminal offense recorded. From these data, we define the probability of a call for service resulting in the report of a Part I crime or that otherwise requires police involvement based on the call's disposition as recorded by the responding officer. Table 2 provides detailed definitions of each call dispositions and Table 3 provides a breakdown of the frequency of each disposition for all calls in the sample. The Technical Appendix contains additional information about the methodology used to determine the probability of crime or the need for police based on observed dispositions.\\n\\nWe also use the time stamps on each service call record to determine how much officer or civilian time is required to clear a service call. Officer time use is determined by calculating total time spent (in hours) responding to each type of call from initial dispatch. Although this is a simple and reliable measure of officer response and investigation time, it may be confounded by factors beyond the incident itself. For example, officers may be required to spend more time on scene for incidents in neighborhoods with more crime or lower perceived police legitimacy\\n\\nbecause citizens may be less willing to cooperate with law enforcement agents (Brunson and Wade 2019; Carr et al. 2007; White et al. 2016). Civilian responders may not encounter these same challenges but may also spend additional time on scene given that arrest or other coercive force cannot be used to resolve the call.\\n\\n\\n## 4.3. Baltimore City Municipal Workforce Data\\n\\n\\nEmployee salary information for BPD officers and other City of Baltimore employees was obtained from the Open Baltimore data hub from 2014 to 2020. These data report the name, title, hire date, and the annual salary of each Baltimore city employee in each fiscal year. We use these data to determine the hourly wage rates of police officers, firefighters with an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), Advanced Life Support (ALS), or Paramedic certification, and social workers. On average, BPD officers earned a base salary of about $69,500 annually, or about $38 per hour between FY15 and FY20. Firefighters earned a comparable hourly wage rate, while social workers earned considerably less ($28/hour). The Technical Appendix contains a detailed summary of the data and method for determining wage rates for City of Baltimore employees.\\n\\nWe pair these wage data with officer time use information derived from the BPD service call dataset to estimate to cost of dispatching uniformed officers or civilians to emergency calls. We accomplish this by adapting the activity-based costing method originally developed by Ellingwood (2016) to the BPD dataset. This costing method considers direct resources required in each call for service, which primarily reflects the cost of officer time spent responding to the call. Given that the CFS dataset does not specify how many officers responded to a call for service, we assume that 2.2 officers respond to each call based on a study of the Phoenix Police Department (Huff 2021).  Mirroring other early adopter cities, we assume that one 7 EMT/ALS/Paramedic and one social worker will respond to emergency calls tasked to civilian responders. We provide a more detailed discussion of each of these decisions in the Technical Appendix.\\n\\n\\n## 4.4. Estimating the Change in Police Time Use and Budgetary Impact of Retasking\\n\\n\\nThis study is motivated by the idea that many activities currently executed by police officers may not require their involvement. Reduction of police-civilian interactions in situations with low-risk of crime but high risk of behavioral health problems may in turn reduce occurrences of police violence and improve police-community relations (Vermeer, Woods, &amp; Jackson 2020). We evaluate the empirical distributions of incident types, call volume, call disposition and time use in BPD calls for service data to assess which activities presently performed by uniformed officers could be done safely by non-enforcement actors such as paramedics or social workers. We then use the results of these analyses to determine the implications of reallocating low-risk calls to civilian responders on BPD officer time use and the city budget. Both estimates are informative separately but require careful consideration when viewed together. The estimate of officer time savings assumes that BPD staffing levels remain constant, which implicitly entails expanded investment in civilian first responders. The estimated financial costs (or savings) represent the difference in the expected costs of responding to a set of calls with police or civilians at a predicted annual volume. Since changes in policing and civilian first-responder practices may affect call volume itself, these estimates cannot be directly interpreted as the subsequent reduction (or increase) in the BPD or Baltimore's city budget.\\n\\nWe define a model to estimate the impact of retasking calls that currently are diverted to civilian responders in the early adopter jurisdictions. We begin by identifying 13 constructs that characterize the labor costs associated with responding to calls for service using patrol officers or civilian first responders. In all, we estimate 30 parameters for this model for which we can assign feasible values from a distribution. Table 4 describes the parameters, distributional assumptions, and definitions of identity functions over which we estimate. The column titled 'Mean/Middle' provides the measure of central tendency that corresponds with each distribution or equation. 8\\n\\nWe then apply Monte Carlo simulation methods to translate the uncertainty in each parameter into a range of estimates concerning officer time use and the budgetary implications\\n\\nof retasking. This approach lets us to describe a complex process in a relatively transparent way and predict its most likely outcome while describing underlying uncertainty about this prediction. In this model, we define a set of set of inputs to capture the process that leads from a 911 call, through emergency response, to its final disposition (e.g., the number of calls received, the probability that a call involves a crime, and the amount of time responders spend on-scene). The relationship between each of these inputs and the outcomes of interest (i.e., time use and expenditure) is defined, and each input is assigned a probability distribution (e.g., uniform, normal, triangular). Finally, the model results are generated over 100,000 trials based on random draws from the input distributions. The mean of the distribution for each outcome is its expected value, and uncertainty is captured by the width of the calculated outcome distribution.\\n\\nWhenever possible, we incorporate model inputs directly from Baltimore administrative data. The frequency of incidents per year (row 1), the proportion of cases that result in police reports (row 2), the share of calls in which a response is feasible (row 3), time spent per incident (row 6), first responder wages (row 8), and call misidentification risk (row 14) are all drawn directly from Baltimore administrative data. A subset of the emergency service calls we consider lack an address, complainant, were unfounded, or were the result of a false alarm. These events do not generate Part I crimes and require less time, on average, compared with calls that require the responder to engage with a member of the public. We therefore make an adjustment for calls that neither a police or civilian responder could conceivable respond to in rows 4 and 6 of the Monte Carlo model.\\n\\nBoth empirically derived measures of the need for police that we evaluate-the probability of Part I crimes and the probability that police are not essential-are agnostic about calltakers' ability to correctly classify calls for service into a specific call category and the need for police action. However, an incorrect initial assessment by the emergency call center can be costly. False negatives-incorrectly identifying an event that should be handled by police as divertible-potentially endangers civilian first responders and public safety generally. False positives-incorrectly identifying an event as high risk-results in inefficient use of police resources and present a chance for the misuse of coercive force. Over the study period in Baltimore, we find the false negative rate is 3.6 percent and the false positive rate is 1.5 percent for the early adopter design scenario. In the model, we only estimate the impact of false negatives. It would be straightforward to incorporate false positives as well, but we exclude this\\n\\ncomponent of the model since Baltimore and other municipalities are likely to err toward a police response when an incident may require one because of risk aversion. We estimate the net effect of false negatives in rows 14-23 of Table 4 assuming both civilian responders and police spend more time than average dealing with cases that are initially misidentified. Standard practice in all operating sites we observed is for civilian first responders to retreat and call for police intervention when they feel they are at risk. This procedure is time-consuming but is seen as essential by program architects since it mitigates safety risks to civilian first responders. We provide a detailed overview of the methodology for evaluating the risk of misidentification in Baltimore 911 calls in the Technical Appendix.\\n\\nA few parameters in the model are defined with less empirical support. For example, row 7 indicates that we expect 2.2 BPD officers (with a s.d. = 1 officer) to respond to each call, on average. Practically, this implies that the Monte Carlo model assumes that, on average, two alternative civilian responder hours replace 2.2 BPD officer hours. We also assume that it will take civilian first responders approximately the same amount of time as BPD officers to resolve incidents, though they might take more or less time. There is no empirical basis for this assumption in Baltimore, but we believe a reasonable range based on field observations is 25 percent faster to three times as long, with a modal time that is equal to BPD time use (row 11). The triangular distribution we specify draws a random variable from this specification. We make similar assumptions in rows 16, 19, and 26.\\n\\nOne common theme in the discussion of civilian re-tasking of police events is that fewer arrests will be made. Although evidence to inform this assumption is again sparse, Dee and Pyne's (2022) quasi-experimental evaluation of the Support Team Assistance Response (STAR) program pilot in Denver provides a baseline estimate to consider. They find that STAR reduced arrests for trespassing, public disorder, and resisting arrest by 33.6 percent in affected neighborhoods, which we use as the middle estimate for arrest reduction parameter. We also multiply their standard error by three when calculating the upper and lower bounds of the distribution of the random variable (row 24). This decision reflects underlying uncertainty about how Dee and Pyne's findings for Denver translate to Baltimore, and results in a distribution of feasible values that ranges from a 56 percent reduction in arrests for these incidents to a very slight increase in arrests. The resulting upper and lower bounds of the predicted change in arrests are not symmetric because Dee and Pyne\\n\\nmodeled log-arrest rates. We assume that the median time spent processing an arrest is 1.5 hours with an upper bound of 4 hours and a lower bound of 0.5 hours. The remaining components of the simulation model (rows 2-4, 9-10, 12-13, 17-18, 21-23, 25, 27-30) are arithmetic steps that are entirely based on the inputs we define above.\\n\\n\\n## 4.5. Three Feasible 911 Diversion Program Design Scenarios\\n\\n\\nA core purpose of 911 call diversion programs is to recast the construct of perceived police utility, which is inherently a normative judgement that likely varies across jurisdictions. For this reason, we present a model that can estimate the impacts of alternative program designs. The primary design scenario we consider is based on existing practices of early adopter U.S. Cities: Albuquerque's ACS, Houston's CCD/MCOT, Atlanta's PAD, and Denver's STAR program. The perspective that diversion programs err too far on the side of caution suggests a potentially broader mandate than those of early adopter cities. We therefore consider two potential alternatives based strictly on the available empirical evidence from Baltimore.\\n\\nThe second design scenario is relatively permissive compared to baseline early adopter scenario. All dispatched incident types with less than a 0.01 (1 percent) probability of generating a Part I crime are reassigned to civilian responders. The permissive design scenario is a potentially drastic departure from current policing practices in the U.S. but offers a simple and useful alternative classification method. This is the most aggressive re-tasking design scenario we consider but is consistent with the logic described by several program architects we interviewed.\\n\\nStill, a narrow focus on the probability of a recorded Part I crime minimizes other less serious crimes that are not systematically recorded in Baltimore administrative data and occasions when police on the scene could be beneficial for reasons other than responses to crime incidents. We also note that some calls for service may still merit a police presence even if a serious crime was not recorded. For example, police frequently mediate disputes or control crowds and traffic at the scene of a non-criminal event. These matters may be handled as effectively by civilians without the authority to coerce individuals, but this assessment is ex ante subjective. Current community oriented policing practices that are unlikely to involve coercive force can generate both tangible immediate benefits to public safety and potential intangible benefits toward police-community relations.\\n\\nThis understanding motivates a third design scenario based on two criteria. First, a service call's Part I crime probability must be less than 0.01, and second, the probability that a police response is essential must be less than 0.1. This latter probability is based largely on officers' own assessments. In the BPD data, we observe four mutually exclusive and complementary officer determined call dispositions for incidents where officers can take action: the probability that a report was written after an incident; as well as the probabilities that 'police [are] not needed', and the incident was 'abated on scene' or 'handled in service.' We consider the latter three dispositions to determine when police were not essential to resolve a call.\\n\\nThis restrictive design scenario will err toward a police response compared to the permissive scenario. It will also call for a police response to certain categories of emergency calls that meet the criteria described above that other early adopter cities already designated as eligible for re-tasking to civilians. We note that many of these calls could be resolved by civilians even if police responders often report that their presence was necessary. For example, disputes where no crime is committed may be resolved by personnel with mediation training. Inperson responses to calls about child neglect without evidence of harm may be ably handled by a social worker. Though the third scenario reassigns certain 911 calls based on current police assessments, we highlight the inherent subjectivity in these judgements.\\n\\nFurther, the threshold choices of 0.01 Part I crime probability and 0.1 probability that police are essential are ultimately arbitrary, but these thresholds are consistent with commonly held perceptions of a 'rare' events in scientific literature. Lowering either threshold represents greater risk aversion, as calls with lower risk of generating a Part I crime are also less likely to present risk of harm to responders and citizens in the immediate vicinity of the incident. Raising either threshold would result in a more expansive set of incidents and would be a relatively drastic action to limit police-community contact.\\n\\nFigure 1 shows the difference in the share of 911 calls to be retasked for each of the three design scenarios. To evaluate the alternative design scenarios using the Monte Carlo model, we change the call diversion choice to be based on the permissive 0.01 Part I crime probability threshold, then we adopt the restrictive filter to include incidents that satisfy both the 0.01 Part I crime probability criterion and the 0.9 police not essential probability. For each specification of the model, we vary the definition of calls for retasking and find new statistics for model parameters #2 through #6, as well as #16.\\n\\n\\n## 5. Results\\n\\n\\n\\n## 5.1. Descriptive Analysis of Call Dispositions and Time Use\\n\\n\\nTable 3 shows a summary of call dispositions over the study period. The data indicate emergency calls assigned to the BPD have an approximately equal probability of four outcomes: the event resulted in a police report ('Report Written'; 0.218), was abated after officers arrived on-scene ('Abated'; 0.251), did not require police response ('Police Not Needed'; 0.260), or could not be processed because the event was unfounded, an address or complainant could not be found, or the event was resolved before police arrived ('Unfounded,' 'No Address,' 'No Complainant,' 'Resolved Before Arrival,' and 'False Alarm'; 0.259).  On average, calls take 48 9 minutes from dispatch to disposition, but the amount of time leading to disposition varies based on the outcome of the call. Police spend approximately 23 minutes on calls that cannot be processed, about one hour when a call can be processed, and two hours when a report is written.\\n\\nFrom these basic summary findings, one practical finding is apparent. Over the seven-year study period, more than 50,000 officer hours-equivalent to about 9 patrol officers per year-are spent responding to calls where the associated address could not be found, assuming that 2.2 patrol officers respond to each call. There are call processing technical solutions to this problem that verify addresses are valid prior to dispatch. It is less apparent whether all calls that are abated by uniformed officers would be similarly abated by a civilian first responder. Based on field observations and to maintain simplicity in the specification of our simulation model, we assume this is the case.\\n\\n\\n## 5.2. Differences in Calls Diverted Across Design Scenarios\\n\\n\\nTable 5 displays counts and probabilities that each incident type yields a Part I crime or that police are not essential (i.e., 'Police Not Needed,' 'Abated,' and 'Handled In Service') for the 25 most frequent CFS types based on calltaker incident descriptions over FY2015 to FY2020. 10 We also indicate the share of calls to which police can respond (i.e., calls where a report is written or police are not essential) and whether each incident type would be retasked\\n\\nbased on each of the three design scenarios. In the calculation of the probability that police are essential, we exclude disposition codes where a response is impossible from the denominators because we calculate probabilities conditional on first responders' ability to respond to the call. Only emergency calls that generated a report also result in a recorded crime. 11\\n\\nFigure 2 visualizes the relationship between need for police response and Part I crime. Responding officers most often indicate that incidents are resolved without a report when a call entails a low likelihood of a reported crime. Many common incident categories rarely result in a recorded crime or the need for a police officer response. For example, fewer than 1 percent of calls involving disorderly persons result in a Part I crime and only 8.5 percent are resolved with a police report filed. Similarly, juvenile disturbances, behavioral crises, parking complaints, and loud noises all fit this description (see Table A2 in the Technical Appendix for these probabilities). By contrast, larceny (0.402 and 0.557), burglary (0.295 and 0.498), aggravated assault (0.259 and 0.619) all entail a very high probability of resulting in a Part I crime. Common assault, which is not a Part I offense but can sometimes result in very serious injuries to the victim, yields a sufficiently high risk of ultimately being declared a Part I crime that no programmatic design scenario we consider would re-task these calls away from police. Narcotics calls, on the other hand, yield very low risk of Part I crime and only result in a police report in 6.6 percent of cases. This suggests that status quo policing practices in Baltimore rarely yield crime or arrest despite the well-known links between drug markets and violent crime. The empirical findings from both our permissive and restrictive models implicitly suggest that some other agent may be more effective than the status quo police practice.\\n\\nWe identify nine incidents to which the early adopter programs respond in the Baltimore calls for service data: behavioral crisis, disorderly person, intoxicated person, lewd act, panhandling, person lying on street, sick person, suicide, and suspicious person. All nine incidents have less than one percent chance of generating a Part I crime, but five of the nine have a probability of requiring police response beyond the 0.1 threshold value we consider, based on police assessments: behavioral crises (0.22), lewd acts (0.19), sick persons (0.13), and suicide (0.241). Thus, on this dimension, early adopter jurisdictions demonstrate less risk aversion than the parameter set in our restrictive design scenario.\\n\\n\\n## 5.3. Estimated Change in Police Time Use and Budgetary Impact of Retasking\\n\\n\\nThe emergency calls eligible for retasking by early adopter cities account for 22 percent of the BPD's call volume. We estimate that the total cost of a police response to these calls in Baltimore is about $6.7 million annually. The estimated new costs associated with increasing the civilian workforce to field first responders to reassigned calls is about $7.8 million (95 percent confidence interval: $4.9 million to $12.1 million). After accounting for additional officer time use savings based on reduced arrests, re-tasking generates about $0.8 million in added public safety expenditure by the City of Baltimore (95 percent confidence interval: -$2.2 million to $4.8 million). Uncertainty about police staffing is a major contributing factor to the wide confidence intervals around each estimate. We assume in the model that first responders will be deployed in pairs; as discussed above, we do not make this assumption about BPD officers.\\n\\nWe find BPD time savings of 107,600 hours per year (95 percent confidence interval: 98,000 - 128,900 hours), which is equivalent to 59 full-time patrol officers (95 percent confidence interval: 43 - 75 officers). One component of this estimate is the budgetary impact of false negatives, which increase the cost of re-tasking by about $0.6 million each year. False negatives increase the total labor cost of emergency call response as they require a police response after the preliminary civilian response. The financial savings from a potential reduction in arrests are trivial in the context of the BPD or police budgets generally but may generate important social externalities for the community. 12 Table 6 summarizes the simulation output and Figure 3 plots the corresponding histograms.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the emergency call response cost estimates above rely on numerous assumptions. The wide variation in these estimates is a consequence of uncertainty in parameters that have weak empirical foundation, particularly the amount of time a civilian firstresponder spends at an incident relative to BPD officers, the number of police or civilians deployed, and the effect of retasking on arrests. One other consideration is how retasking is accomplished. Baltimore could opt to hold the police force size constant while adding additional civilian workers needed to meet the emergency call demand. This effectively increases total\\n\\nmunicipal spending on public safety. Alternatively, the city could reduce the police force size commensurate with the reduced emergency call demand, effectively replacing uniformed officers with civilians. Here, practical grounding is important. Given that BPD is already operating well below its planned force size, the city may be unlikely to consider further cuts without external pressure.\\n\\nAdditional sensitivity analysis indicates that BPD officer hours that can be diverted and the net cost of responses to calls for service is positively related to the Part I crime probability threshold, but so too is uncertainty around the model's estimates. Figure 4 plots the estimates derived from the specifications corresponding to our main early adopter design scenario alongside the restrictive and permissive design scenarios that require probability that Part I crime risk to be below 0.01 and the probability that police response is essential to be below 0.10. The expected budget impact remains negligible across these alternative scenarios. However, we demonstrate that greater patrol officer time savings can be realized under both the restrictive and permissive design scenarios. The estimated officer time savings under the permissive scenario is statistically greater than those under the restrictive scenario ( z = 6.65, p &lt; 0.001). Similarly, the estimated officer time savings under restrictive scenario is statistically greater than the early adopter scenario (  = 3.85, z p &lt; 0.001). However, we only find a statistically significance difference in the expected program cost between the early adopter and permissive scenarios (  = z 2.29, p = 0.022). Due to the inherent risk of diverting calls based on Part I crime risk alone, the estimated impact of the permissive design scenario carries considerably more uncertainty, which is reflected by systematically wider confidence intervals.\\n\\n\\n## 6. Discussion and Conclusion\\n\\n\\nPolice reform advocates contend that many emergency calls could be addressed by civilian social workers, thereby improving police efficiency, performance, and relations with the community. We add to this conversation by measuring and monetizing time use explicitly, and by identifying a broad set of calls for service that are suitable candidates for re-tasking based on the risk that they coincide with an ongoing crime that may endanger the first responder or otherwise require a sworn officer. We specifically consider these reforms in the context of Baltimore, a majority Black or African American city with an above average crime rate and police expenditure.\\n\\nOur primary objective in this analysis is to present a model by which the complex decisions required to design a 911 call diversion program can be systematically evaluated. While the simulation model we define is value free, the assumptions we make in the alternative models are not. As William James opined, 'Objective evidence and certitude are doubtless very fine ideals to play with, but where on this moonlit and dream-visited planet are they found?' Although there is no objectively correct specification of this model, we attempt to make reasonable, systematic, and transparent assumptions to inform policymakers about the potential costs and benefits of diversion programs. In this analysis, we assume police are uniquely qualified to respond to crime events, but civilians may provide adequate or superior response to other types of emergencies. Although we limit the model to evaluate diversion to civilian responders only, many jurisdictions now deploy community resource officers as an alternative to response by traditional police officers. To demonstrate the utility of the model, we define three feasible program design scenarios for Baltimore specifically. However, we encourage researchers and practitioners to add, remove, or adjust the model's current assumptions to reflect the available data on 911 responses in their jurisdiction as they see fit.\\n\\nAdapting the existing practices of early adopter call diversion programs currently operating in four large U.S. cities, we estimate that at least one-in-five calls that are currently fielded by patrol officers in Baltimore can be successfully diverted to civilian responders. The resulting budgetary impact of such a change are negligible, but the time savings to officers and intangible benefits to the community are not. During field work for this study, we observed civilian teams respond to calls involving persons experiencing mental health crises by employing de-escalation methods to gain trust and gather information about the situation and individuals involved, methodically working to resolve the incident. This may lead to quicker resolution of some cases but may also take hours to play out. According to stakeholders, many of the responders' interactions with these individuals were made possible only by the absence of a police uniform and weapon. This leads us to surmise that successful diversion programs will increase total effort expended on 911 call responses in the short term because the rate of calls that lead to dead ends-e.g., a complainant or person requiring assistance leaves or refuses help-will fall with time. In the long-term, individuals who repeatedly call 911 for non-criminal matters may be more likely to find resolution through civilian response. In the jurisdictions we observed, police perceive the benefits of diversion programs both through the reduction in workload that falls\\n\\noutside of core policing duties and through their ability to spend more time on proactive and community-oriented policing tasks. The early adopter design scenario is in some ways conservative about the variety of incidents to which civilians can respond, but it does include incidents when police reports are written and arrests are probable in far more than ten percent of cases, including suicidal ideation calls and behavioral crises. These situations may give rise to inappropriate use of force as persons under duress may be made more volatile by a police presence.\\n\\nPolice (mis)use of force is particularly salient for predominantly Black communities as well. Officers are more likely to use force against Black residents (Knox et al.; 2020; Hoekstra and Sloan, 2022) and in neighborhoods with a larger share of Black residents (Lautenschlager and Omori, 2019). Therefore, diverting calls to civilian responders may be especially beneficial in predominantly Black communities, where the number of interactions with police (and opportunities for force to occur) should be reduced. To be sure, racial disparities in the use of force may not decrease because of diversionary programs, especially if there is no variation in their implementation across neighborhoods. However, given that the frequency of low-level interactions with police should decrease generally with diversionary programs, they could be especially beneficial to communities that are predominantly Black.\\n\\nWe also consider alternative programmatic scenarios based on Part I crime risk and the necessity of a police response in the absence of a crime. Approximately 57 percent of all calls for service currently tasked to uniformed officers have less than a one percent chance of resulting in a Part I crime. Over 40 percent have less than one percent chance of Part I crime and less than 10 percent chance of requiring a police response based on police assessments. However, there is also a small chance that these calls are misidentified at dispatch and will subsequently result in a crime. In supplemental analyses presented in the Technical Appendix, we show that call misidentification risk is relatively constant across communities of varied socioeconomic characteristics after accounting for call-specific characteristics. While the data and analysis show that call misidentification is rare, the stakes are large. In such a situation, the first responder and the community may face threats that a uniformed officer is best suited to resolve.\\n\\nFinally, we consider the time use and financial implications of re-tasking these calls. Transitioning emergency calls from police to civilians has the potential to reduce the labor cost of completing calls for service. Although the estimated cost difference is negligible when\\n\\ncompared against the BPD's annual budget for police patrol, retasking calls currently fielded by early adopter programs may greatly reduce officer time spent on CFS. The IACP recommend that patrol officers should spend 30 percent of their time responding to CFS (International Association of Chiefs of Police 2023). While the true share in Baltimore is unknown and likely higher, the potential reduction in workload associated with early adopter program calls is equivalent to nearly 30 percent of the total time BPD's roughly 690 patrol officers should devote to CFS, consistent with the 9 percent of all patrol officer time we estimate directly. Many U.S. cities currently utilize a 'co-response' or model where sworn officers and civilian clinicians are jointly dispatched to suitable calls for service. This hybrid approach may improve the outcomes of these emergency calls in some cases, but may also require greater labor input which increases the cost of response.\\n\\nThis analysis has several notable limitations. First, the study period is bookended by tumultuous events. It begins with the April 2015 death of Freddie Gray while in police custody which was followed by a historic increase in violent crime in Baltimore. It ends during the COVID-19 Pandemic which had a profound effect on all aspects of life in Baltimore, including the criminal justice system. These events may have impacted the composition of emergency calls received, time use estimates, and the disposition of cases. We elected to incorporate all available data because we cannot yet distinguish whether these shocks led to momentary disruptions in patterns or systemic changes. It is difficult to gauge their impact on the external validity of our estimates, though it is worthwhile to note that many other U.S. cities faced these same challenges during this period.\\n\\nSecond, we assume that officers accurately report incidents. If false positives are undercounted and officers tend to overstate the need for police response and risk of crime, then this analysis is biased toward underestimates the potential financial benefits associated with retasking. In the less likely case that officers understate the need for police, this analysis underestimates the potential costs. In both cases, officers' misrepresentation of public safety risks may produce large intangible social costs. Indeed, prior research suggests that misrepresentation or misreporting may be motivated by a desire to manipulate crime data (Eterno et al., 2016). Failure to correctly dispatch civilians or police to the service calls where they are required may generate social costs such as reduced legitimacy and trust in police.\\n\\nThird, our cost estimates reflect only the labor costs associated with calls for service. There\\n\\nare numerous other costs that are not considered, including training, emergency vehicles, supplies, and the support workers that facilitate emergency response. A conservative assumption is that these costs are equivalent whether the call is handled by civilians or BPD officers. 13 We further assume that civilian workers respond to and resolve calls for service at the same speed as sworn officers. It is plausible that civilian workers will take longer to peacefully resolve some calls for service given that arrest is not option to terminate the encounter. Further, police may still be required even after initial response by a civilian. These scenarios increase the cost of deploying civilians in lieu of officers. In addition, some emergency calls are suitable for social workers, while others will entail medical emergencies that require paramedics or EMTs; these details were not available in our data. A policy of deploying EMT-social worker responder pairs is inefficient, but probably appropriate given the uncertainty associated with responding to an emergency call. It is also likely that EMTs are currently deployed along with BPD officers to many calls for service. Calls for accidents, non-breathing, behavioral crises, overdoses, persons lying on street, and sick persons account for nearly 40 percent of calls with under a one-percent probability of generating a Part I crime record. In this case, replacing the modal response of two sworn officers plus EMT with a single EMT-social worker pair would achieve greater cost savings than our model predicts.\\n\\nWe also make important simplifying assumptions about the composition of first responders to calls for service. However, given the police staffing shortage, single officers may currently respond to some calls for service. We also assume fixed EMT-social worker teams are the only alternative responders, but other combinations of skilled civilian responders are possible. For example, the Albuquerque's ACS Department deploys civilian first responders based on incident acuity. Mobile crisis teams comprised of a police officer and a mental health clinician respond to the most acute situations, while behavioral health responders respond to less acute behavioral crises and other non-criminal events and community responders handle other less urgent calls. Our model's civilian responders approximate Albuquerque's behavioral health responders who are paid higher wages and require more training than community responders. In this sense, our\\n\\nmodel may then understate potential cost savings compared to other feasible program designs. On the other hand, behavioral health responders cannot respond to more acute events where crime risk is low, but higher than the threshold we consider. In sum, our analysis considers only a single civilian response model even though more sophisticated alternative models may be feasible.\\n\\nOne other important consideration is the role of emergency communication centers to facilitate successful re-tasking efforts. Calltakers and dispatchers must be able to effectively determine whether a call for service meets the criteria for a civilian responder. However, recent research suggests that many emergency dispatch centers are not equipped with enough staff or training to make these judgments (Pew Charitable Trusts 2021). Moreover, 911 dispatchers experience high rates of burnout and high turnover (Linos, Ruffini, &amp; Wilcoxen 2022). A successful re-tasking effort will entail an ongoing investment in dispatcher training and support, with attention toward minimizing call misidentification. Disagreement between the initial and final description of the incident can be due to a combination of the calltaker, dispatcher, or responding officers. Our model assumes these factors are exogenous to call diversion program design.\\n\\nWe also assume that calls with the disposition codes 'abated' and 'handled in service' are resolved similarly whether a civilian or police response occurs. This assumption may not hold in practice. For example, narcotics calls may frequently be coded as 'abated' because the scene clears when police arrive, or complainants are unwilling or unable to provide further information. An EMT and social worker may not have this deterrent (or displacement) effect. If, instead, these civilian responders are more likely to engage with the complainant or complainee then our model underestimates the costs of retasking. However, if these interactions lead to a reduction in delinquency through referral to beneficial programming or through a more general social control mechanism, then our model may understate the positive impacts of retasking. Our estimates of police time use and service costs may be biased to the extent that these factors vary over time or location and are not taken into account.\\n\\nWhile this analysis is focused on the time use and cost implications of call diversion, the broader literature on civil-police relations suggests there may be significant nonpecuniary benefits that we do not consider in this paper. As abovementioned, reduced police involvement in low-risk emergency calls lowers the likelihood of violence between police and marginalized\\n\\ncommunities. Even if officers' propensity to misuse force against people from marginalized groups remains the same, the frequency of harmful incidents may decrease. Greater reliance on social workers and treatment programs may also improve community wellbeing, especially given that many programs entail follow-ups by civilian responders (Irwin &amp; Pearl 2020). These followups generate financial and social benefits and may reduce the likelihood of future 911 calls concerning these individuals. Diversion programs may even improve police-community relations, as residents learn over time that calling 911 may indeed return the kind of help they are seeking. However, it is also plausible that these programs may harm perceptions of police legitimacy if a civilian is mistakenly dispatched to an event that requires a police response. Municipalities that introduce a new diversion program should carefully monitor citizen satisfaction and perceptions of police and civilian responders to ensure the program enhances public safety.\\n\\n\",\n          \"## Introduction\\n\\n\\nIn advanced economies, taxation is the most important source of government revenues, often accounting for more than 80 percent of total revenue. Historically, tax revenues grew substantially in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century (Kiser and Karceski, 2017; Seelkopf et al., 2021), and they rose significantly during and after the First and Second World War (Scheve and Stasavage, 2010, 2016). This increase in revenue was largely generated through progressive income taxation, which was used to finance the expansion of the welfare state. During the heyday of Keynesianism in the postwar era, taxation was used to redistribute incomes but steer resources into specific economic sectors (Haffert, 2021; Swank and Steinmo, 2002).\\n\\nFrom the 1980s onward, however, marginal income and corporate tax rates were significantly reduced, as the new tax doctrine was more concerned with efficiency than equity or allocation (Swank, 2006). A general shift from income to consumption taxes occurred (Haffert and Schulz, 2020; Steinmo, 2003), as progressive taxes and taxes on capital were lowered. For example, in the UK, the last pound of earned income at the highest tax bracket was essentially entirely taxed in 1978 (98 percent); since the 2010s, the corresponding figure is less than half (45 percent) (Chancel et al., 2021). Today, the top marginal income tax rate is between half and a third of what it used to be at its highest point in the twentieth century.\\n\\nIt is commonly assumed that this new tax doctrine is also rooted in public opinion. In the first instance, taxes reduce the disposable income of all taxpaying citizens, who are thus said to oppose higher taxes (Ballard-Rosa et al., 2017; Barnes, 2015; Berens and Gelepithis, 2019; Roosma et al., 2016). Although there is demand for a more progressive tax system (Ballard-Rosa et al., 2017; Barnes, 2015, 2022), voters generally favor lower tax levels. In liberal democracies, this generates pressure for governments to cut taxes. For example, in 2001 and 2003, a large share of Americans supported the tax cuts by the Bush administration (Bartels, 2005).\\n\\nHowever, the widespread support for lower taxes undermines the ability of governments to maintain or increase government spending. Today, efforts to tackle some of the most pressing policy challenges of our time, such as inequality or climate change, are regularly watered down due to limited fiscal resources, while the costs of these challenges are mounting. Discussions about introducing wealth taxes or raising income or value added taxes to raise the necessary\\n\\nfunds frequently fail. This is surprising, given that existing research also shows that voters do, indeed, support climate change mitigation (Dechezlepr\\u00eatre et al., 2022) or welfare state spending (Garritzmann et al., 2018; H\\u00e4usermann et al., 2022).\\n\\nIn a nutshell, these preferences are puzzling: While citizens support higher government spending, they do not want to pay for it through higher taxes. Voters are thus said to want 'something for nothing' (Sears and Citrin, 1982) or 'more for less' (Welch, 1985). However, existing research which argues that citizens support lower levels of taxes usually relies on simple, unidimensional measures of support for a given policy (e.g., should the government increase/decrease general income taxes?). This begs the question to what extent citizens still support lower taxes when they conflict with other fiscal policy goals.\\n\\nIt is commonly assumed that high-income and right-leaning citizens support lower taxes, either due to self-interest or ideological reasons (e.g., Ballard-Rosa et al., 2017; Barnes, 2015; Hennighausen and Heinemann, 2015; Meltzer and Richard, 1981). But how strong is this support once the fiscal trade-offs are acknowledged? Moreover, what are the preferences of people who are cross-pressured, i.e., who are pulled in opposite directions based on their ideology and economic self-interest? Extensive research has shown that left-wing parties have experienced a middle-class shift as structural economic change has substantially increased the incomes of some left-wing voters (Gingrich and H\\u00e4usermann, 2015; Oesch, 2013). Due to rising educational attainment and occupational upgrading, there is an increasing number of people who have high incomes but still support left-wing parties. Therefore, it is important to ask whether these voters respond more strongly to their self-interest or ideology regarding their tax preferences. This crucially determines whether a progressive coalition that opposes tax cuts, composed of low-income and left-wing respondents, is possible.\\n\\nWe contend that unidimensional survey questions likely overstate support for the low tax doctrine because they fail to capture the multidimensionality and complex trade-offs of fiscal policies. Governments must constantly decide how to balance spending and revenues in various areas. Consequently, the necessity to make trade-offs is inherent in fiscal policies. Politicians and policymakers have to weigh the relative merits of various tax and spending plans and find compromises between often conflicting ideal worlds. This should be mirrored in survey questions, where respondents need to weigh their preferences and decide which policy they prioritize .\\n\\nWe thus build on novel research that takes fiscal policy trade-offs seriously (Barnes et al., 2022; Bremer and B\\u00fcrgisser, 2022a) by using data from an original survey experiment conducted in Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, which allows us to assess how the demand for lower taxes changes when tax cuts come into conflict with other fiscal policy aims. To this end, we confronted respondents with different distributive policy trade-offs. Respondents were randomly assigned to four groups: one control group and three treatment groups. In each group, respondents evaluated three statements on general income tax, top income tax, and value added tax (VAT). Respondents in the control group were given traditional, unidimensional survey statements, while the treatment groups were given statements that raised awareness to different distributive trade-offs with government spending, government debt, or other taxes.\\n\\nOur results show that support for lower income taxes and VAT drops profoundly when it implies lower government spending or higher government debt, while lower top income taxes are always unpopular. On the individual level, preferences are influenced by both self-interest and ideology: high-income as well as right-wing respondents favor trade-offs that have the most regressive distributive effects compared to low-income and left-wing respondents. However, for high-income individuals, ideology dominates: high-income, left voters are even more likely to oppose lower taxes than low-income voters.\\n\\nOverall, the paper makes important contributions. First, we contribute to a new and growing literature on policy trade-offs. In a seminal analysis twenty years ago, Boeri et al. (2001) demonstrated that a positive orientation towards a single policy does not necessarily mean that citizens also opt for this policy when they learn that they have to pay its price through higher taxes or social security contributions. Such hard choice settings and their determinants have recently moved to the center of analyses of social and fiscal policies (Barnes et al., 2022; Bremer and B\\u00fcrgisser, 2022a,b; Busemeyer and Neimanns, 2017; Busemeyer and Garritzmann, 2017; Gallego and Marx, 2017; H\\u00e4usermann et al., 2019, 2022; H\\u00fcbscher et al., 2021). We enrich this literature by putting taxes front and center. We study public opinion regarding myriad trade-offs between different forms of taxation, government spending, and government debt. Our results demonstrate that support for lower taxes is not unconditional: when respondents learn that the outcome is lower government spending or higher debt, support for lower taxes declines noticeably. Consequently, support for tax cuts is not as high as it is commonly assumed.\\n\\nSecond, we contribute to the vast literature on preferences towards redistribution and taxation (e.g., Cavaill\\u00e9 and Trump, 2015; Iversen and Soskice, 2001; Lupu and Pontusson, 2011). Our results show that particularly regressive changes to the tax systems are the least popular, while more progressive changes enjoy more widespread support. Moreover, it indicates that different respondents react differently to trade-offs. As expected, support for progressive changes to the tax system declines with higher income and increases with a more left-wing attitude.\\n\\nStill, ideology affects the evaluation of trade-offs more strongly than self-interest among highincome, left-wing citizens; they are equally likely to oppose lower taxes as low-income citizens. Hence, only people on the right support lower taxes at all costs. In line with existing work on attitudes towards redistribution Armingeon and Weisstanner (2021) and taxation (Stiers et al., 2022), this finding is important because it implies that a progressive coalition against lower taxes, combining low-income citizens and high-income 'leftists', may be viable.\\n\\nTo make these arguments, we first briefly review the literature on general attitudes toward taxation and further explain the paper's motivation. Second, we develop theoretical expectations about how citizens prioritize different tax policies when they are fiscal policy trade-offs. Then we explain the research design, before we present and discuss the results of the experiment. In the final section, we conclude with a discussion of the broader implications.\\n\\n\\n## General Attitudes Towards Taxation\\n\\n\\nThe study of preferences towards taxation has received increasing interest over the last decade. Although the micro-determinants of attitudes towards taxation are less well understood than the determinants of attitudes towards government spending, the literature shows that most voters are reluctant to pay higher taxes (Ballard-Rosa et al., 2017; Barnes, 2015; Roosma et al., 2016; Berens and Gelepithis, 2019). As voters' tax preferences are largely shaped by their (perceived) self-interest (e.g., Franko et al., 2013; Levi, 1988; Meltzer and Richard, 1981), many oppose tax increases. Although individuals benefit from government services in return for taxes, they are often badly informed about their position in the income distribution and about the effect of\\n\\ntax policies (Bartels, 2005; Fern\\u00e1ndez-Albertos and Kuo, 2018; Roberts et al., 1994; Stantcheva, 2021). They view higher taxes as a burden that reduces their disposable income, especially consumption taxes (VAT and general income taxes), and misperceive who benefits and lose from different taxes (Franko et al., 2013; Boudreau and MacKenzie, 2018).\\n\\nOpposition towards higher levels of taxation was not always as widespread. According to Scheve and Stasavage (2010, 2016), the introduction of progressive income taxation in the early twentieth was mainly driven by mass conscription for warfare. It led to demands for an increase in taxation levied on society's wealthiest to distribute the burden of the war across society. Similarly, Limberg (2020) shows that the financial bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis increased demands for higher taxes on the rich, while Dodson (2017) finds that economic recessions more generally increase support for progressive taxes among the working class (see also GarciaMuniesa, 2019).\\n\\nFollowing Barnes (2015), it is, therefore, important to distinguish between preferences for the size of taxation (tax level) and the structure of taxation (tax progressivity), as the modal respondent in seventeen advanced industrial countries favors lower tax levels but higher progressivity. Similarly, (Ballard-Rosa et al., 2017) show that among the American public, preferences for taxes are progressive, although they are largely in line with current tax policies in the US. Likewise, Berens and Gelepithis (2021, p. 386) argue that higher levels of taxation are politically unpopular in advanced and developing countries, but that the principle of progressivity enjoys widespread support. Voters expect the rich to contribute more, and this is especially true when demands for taxing the rich are linked to political arguments about why this is fair (Limberg, 2020; Scheve and Stasavage, 2010, 2016). It is, therefore, important to distinguish preferences towards different types of taxes with different distributive effects.\\n\\nIn this paper, we focus on public opinion towards three types of taxes with distinct distributive consequences: general income tax, top income tax, and value added tax. An increase or decrease in the general income tax (across all income brackets) has a relatively neutral distributive effect. A top income tax is generally acknowledged as a progressive tax, where a decrease would imply a regressive and an increase a progressive distributive effect. Finally, a value added tax is a regressive tax, where a decrease would imply a progressive and an increase a regressive distributive effect. Since we are mainly interested in the extent to which public opinion favors\\n\\nFigure 1: Support for lower income tax, lower top income tax, and lower value added tax Note: The figure shows the distribution of (dis-) agreement with statements that 'the government should lower taxes on . . . '. The scale goes from 0 to 10, where 0 means 'totally disagree' and 10 means 'totally agree'.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\ntax decreases, we asked respondents to what extent they agree/disagree with a lower income tax, lower top income tax, and lower value added tax (for more details on the survey, see the research design section). Figure 1 shows that citizens, on average, strongly support lower income and lower value added taxes, while a huge group is strongly against lowering top income taxes. As we argue in the next section, however, claims that demands for lower taxes are strongly rooted in public opinion based on such unidimensional measures of support/opposition towards a specific tax should be met with skepticism.\\n\\n\\n## Tax Cuts and Fiscal Policy Trade-Offs\\n\\n\\nKey to our argument is that different survey designs influence the expression of political preferences and choices that researchers record. As discussed above, the majority of research examines unconstrained fiscal policy attitudes, i.e., it assesses the public's reaction to individual tax policies or spending items. Estimating support for a given policy, where no price tag or trade-off is attached, arguably elicits general orientations about a policy's desirability. However, this approach can be misleading because it ignores the complexity of fiscal policies.\\n\\nWhen designing budgets, governments must always make trade-offs between spending money in different areas and collecting revenues from various sources. Therefore, fiscal policy must necessarily involve trade-offs. Politicians and policymakers need to weigh the relative merits of various tax and spending schemes and find a middle ground between divergent ideals. In contrast to unconstrained preference questions, respondents in choice settings, where the decision to expand one policy entails a decision against the expansion of another policy, have to weigh their preferences and reach a conclusion about which policy they prioritize .\\n\\nAs a result, policymakers would be well-served to avoid relying on unidimensional position questions to gauge public sentiment. The resulting signals are incoherent since citizens can support higher spending, lower taxes, and lower debt at the same time. In contrast, studying priorities provides valuable information to policymakers and scholars alike about which policies citizens deem essential (see also, Hanretty et al., 2020). Thus, an emerging body of research has explicitly studied trade-offs in the realm of fiscal policy (Bansak et al., 2021; Barnes et al., 2022; Bremer and B\\u00fcrgisser, 2022a; H\\u00fcbscher et al., 2021; Tuxhorn et al., 2021), social policy (Bremer and B\\u00fcrgisser, 2022b; Busemeyer and Garritzmann, 2017; Gallego and Marx, 2017; H\\u00e4usermann et al., 2019), and environmental policy (Armingeon and B\\u00fcrgisser, 2021).\\n\\nBased on this research, we hypothesize that when respondents are confronted with real-world trade-offs, support for lower taxes is not as deeply ingrained in the public's mindset as it is commonly assumed. The explanation for this is simple: despite findings suggesting that citizens are in favor of lowering the tax burden, this does not square well with other evidence claiming that citizens also favor higher government spending (Garritzmann et al., 2018; H\\u00e4usermann et al., 2022) and lower government debt (Bansak et al., 2021; Brender and Drazen, 2008; Peltzman, 1992). When respondents are informed about the consequences of lower taxes, their preferences may change. For example, Williamson (2017) uses qualitative data from the United States to show that people are more willing to pay taxes when they believe that the money is used to pay for government spending, especially if they perceive it as worthwhile. Using a novel survey experiment that presents respondents with deficit-neutral changes to the budget, Barnes et al. (2022) similarly show that in the UK, citizens are willing to pay for higher spending through tax increases on the scale of seven percent of the total tax bill. This also extends to the US and other European countries, where citizens are open to higher taxes to raise spending or to balance the budget (Bremer and B\\u00fcrgisser, 2022a; Tuxhorn et al., 2021).\\n\\nIn light of these findings, we contend that when citizens are told about the trade-offs associated with lower taxes, some of them will inevitably place greater importance on government debt or government spending than lower taxes. This reduces the overall support for lower taxes; thus, we expect the following:\\n\\nHypothesis 1 . On average, support for lower taxes declines when respondents are confronted with fiscal trade-offs (lower government spending or higher government debt) .\\n\\n\\n## Theory\\n\\n\\n\\n## Heterogeneous Effects by Self-Interest and Ideology\\n\\n\\nThe way that citizens respond to trade-offs should vary across individuals. In particular, the literature has put forward two explanations that could help to account for citizens' fiscal policy choices: material self-interest and ideology.\\n\\nFirst, citizens do not only evaluate policies based on their expected aggregate (distributive) effects, but they also consider the consequences on their own pocketbook, i.e., citizens prefer to maximize their disposable income. Therefore, citizens' attitudes towards fiscal policies and redistribution are likely strongly rooted in their immediate material circumstances. From a myopic self-interest perspective (e.g., Iversen and Soskice, 2001; Meltzer and Richard, 1981; Lupu and Pontusson, 2011; Rueda and Stegmueller, 2019), the median voter's objective in the MeltzerRichard model is to maximize their income. Citizens with incomes below the population median are expected to favor greater redistribution through increased social spending or higher and more progressive taxation, while citizens with incomes above the population median are more inclined to favor lower social spending and less progressive taxation because their disposable income is more directly influenced by changes in taxation than government spending.\\n\\nThese different preferences should translate into priorities regarding fiscal policy trade-offs. High-income respondents are less likely to benefit from government spending and tax redistribution. They should prioritize trade-offs that have regressive effects. Low-income respondents, on the other hand, should favor trade-offs that have progressive effects. Consequently, high-income citizens should be more supportive of lowering progressive taxation than low-income citizens. The effect of income should be particularly pronounced if lower progressive taxes have regressive trade-offs, i.e., if lower progressive taxes come at the expense of lower spending or higher regres-\\n\\nsive taxes. If lower regressive taxes come at the cost of higher progressive taxes or higher debt, the difference between high- and low-income respondents should be smaller or even reversed, as those with high incomes prefer regressive taxation to progressive taxation and spending. The differences between high- and low-income individuals should be small if lower regressive taxes result in lower spending. Overall, we expect the following:\\n\\nHypothesis 2 . High-income (low-income) respondents should more strongly prioritize trade-offs that have the most regressive (progressive) distributive effects.\\n\\nHowever, it is unlikely that individuals just consider their own material self-interest when evaluating trade-offs. Political ideology is a second factor explaining policy choices. Most of the literature has shown that left-wing individuals are more likely to support welfare state expansion and redistribution through taxation (e.g., Franko et al., 2013; J\\u00e6ger, 2008). In general, leftleaning citizens advocate for higher levels of public spending than right-leaning citizens. In contrast, right-wing voters are more likely to support a lean state, that collects fewer revenues. Moreover, considerations of fairness (Alesina and La Ferrara, 2005; Fong, 2001; Scheve and Stasavage, 2016), which correlate with ideology, shape preferences; they especially influence support for 'taking from the rich' (Cavaill\\u00e9 and Trump, 2015). Hence, partisan considerations strongly correlate with preferences over tax progressivity (Ballard-Rosa et al., 2017): people do not only consider how taxation affects their own material interest but also how it affects the incomes of others (L\\u00fc and Scheve, 2016). As a result, redistribution considerations strongly influence respondents' tax preferences (Stantcheva, 2021), as people who identify as left-wing are firmly in favor of progressive taxes (Stiers et al., 2022).\\n\\nBased on this evidence, we expect that right-wing individuals are more likely to support lower taxes than left-wing individuals. Again, though, the type of taxation should matter because some taxes are progressive while others are regressive effects, and lower taxes come with trade-offs as well. In particular, we expect that those on the left are less supportive of lower progressive taxes, particularly if they result in lower spending or higher regressive taxes. When it comes to regressive taxes, this difference should be smaller or even reversed: right-wing individuals may be less supportive of lower regressive taxes, especially if they come at the cost of higher progressive taxes or higher government debt. The gap between left- and right-wing respondents\\n\\nshould be small if lower regressive taxes result in lower government spending. Overall, we expect the following.\\n\\nHypothesis 3 . Right-wing (left-wing) respondents should more strongly prioritize trade-offs that have the most regressive (progressive) distributive effects.\\n\\n\\n## Cross-Pressured Citizens\\n\\n\\nIt is likely that some individuals experience cross-cutting conflicts. Due to structural economic changes in advanced economies, particularly through the processes of educational expansion and occupational upgrading (Oesch, 2013), party electorates have been substantially transformed (Gingrich and H\\u00e4usermann, 2015). While the political left nowadays successfully appeals to many educated middle-class voters whose incomes have grown (e.g., Kitschelt, 1994; Piketty, 2021), the political right, in contrast, increasingly appeals to people with lower levels of education and incomes (Kitschelt and Rehm, 2022; Oesch and Rennwald, 2018). This amplifies the possibility of cross-cutting conflicts which emerge from the combination of income and ideology: on the one hand, left-leaning, high-income citizens likely experience opposing pressures from ideology (in favor of redistribution) and self-interest (against redistribution), while right-leaning, while low-income citizens likely suffer a conflict between ideology (against redistribution) and self-interest (in favor of redistribution). On the other hand, low-income left-wing and highincome right-wing citizens are likely not subject to comparable pressures in opposing directions and should be able to make clear decisions in favor of or against redistribution.\\n\\nIn line with findings on general preferences towards redistribution by Margalit (2013) and Armingeon and Weisstanner (2021), we make the assumption that ideology takes precedence over self-interest, especially among left-leaning individuals. The pursuit of material self-interest is substantially at odds with the notion of social solidarity among the left. Even though left-leaning, high-income citizens have a self-interest in less redistribution and lower taxes, this goes against the fundamental tenet of being on the left. Fairness considerations and altruism are particularly strong among those individuals, which has an influence on how the rich perceive redistribution (Dimick et al., 2016; L\\u00fc and Scheve, 2016). Existing evidence suggests that income has little bearing on support for progressive taxation, especially among politically sophisticated voters\\n\\n(Stiers et al., 2022). 1 Consequently, we suppose that they resolve the tension between ideology and self-interest by giving greater weight to their ideological orientation and demonstrating stronger support for redistribution.\\n\\nIn contrast, material self-interest aligns well with the pro-market philosophy of the right. Right-leaning, low-income citizens are less likely to be ardent supporters of redistribution due to ideological grounds, but they are still more likely to do so than right-leaning, high-income citizens. Cross-pressured high-income 'leftists' are, therefore, more prone to forego their own self-interest than low-income right-leaning citizens.\\n\\nHypothesis 4 . The positive effect of income on the priority for regressive trade-offs is weaker among left-wing respondents than right-wing respondents.\\n\\n\\n## Research Design\\n\\n\\nTo test our expectations, we fielded a survey in four large European countries: Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom (UK). In each country, we recruited 1,200 respondents from a pool of eligible voters through large online panels provided by Qualtrics. The sample was representative of all eligible voters based on gender and age. The survey was fielded simultaneously in 2018. 2 Appendix A provides more information about the survey, our sample, and the quality tests that we employed to receive a high-quality sample.\\n\\nWe designed a simple split-sample survey experiment to overcome problems associated with conventional surveys while making modest cognitive demands upon respondents (see Table 1). We randomly split our respondents into four different experimental groups, including one control group and three treatment groups. In each group, we asked respondents to evaluate statements on general income tax, top income tax, and value added tax (VAT). These three taxes were selected to represent direct and indirect taxes and are among the politically most visible and salient forms of taxation. More pertinent to our case, these taxes have very different distributive effects. A change in the general income tax has relatively neutral distributive effects across all\\n\\nTable 1: Design of the survey experiment.\\n\\nNote: The table shows the vignettes assigned to respondents in the four different experimental groups. It also includes our theoretical expectation about the distributive impact of the proposed policy change (neutral, regressive, progressive).\\n\\nincome brackets. A top income tax has a strongly progressive distributive effect. Finally, a value added tax is usually characterized as a regressive form of taxation.\\n\\nRespondents in the control group were asked standard, one-dimensional statements, while respondents in the treatment groups were exposed to statements that emphasized different tradeoffs in order to gauge how the demand for lower taxes changes when it conflicts with other fiscal policy objectives. All respondents were subsequently asked how much they agreed or disagreed with these statements on a scale from 0 to 10 (where higher values indicate higher levels of support). We use the answers to these questions as dependent variables, which enables us to examine the degree to which particular fiscal policy trade-offs are more appealing than others by comparing support across the different experimental groups. 3\\n\\nTo reduce complexity and cognitive fatigue for the respondents, we restricted the number of trade-offs to those theoretically most interesting. We always included one trade-off related to government spending and one related to government debt. The last trade-off is either related to VAT or income tax increases. Further, we made all statements relative to the status quo and do not quantify the specific trade-offs. Thanks to this simplification, we were able to carry out the same experiment in several countries, irrespective of the country's existing fiscal policies (e.g., tax levels and spending levels).\\n\\nAlthough there are reasons to expect some differences across countries, the focus of this paper is less on cross-country comparisons and more on the individual level of respondents. We know from the policy feedback literature that preferences are embedded in social and fiscal policy institutions (Korpi and Palme, 1998; Kumlin, 2004; Brooks and Manza, 2007; Larsen, 2008). They are endogenous to the institutional design of the welfare state and the tax system because these institutions are ultimately rooted in different norms and concepts of reciprocal altruism (Alesina et al., 2001). We acknowledge the possibility of country-specific effects but, given the low number of countries in our study, we refrain from focusing on them. Still, the four countries included in this study, represent major European economies with advanced welfare states, including different varieties of capitalism (Hall and Soskice, 2001) and different welfare state regimes (Esping-Andersen, 1990). This gives us sufficient variation to check whether individual country differences influence our results. 4 Appendix D.1 thus presents our main results for each country individually. 5\\n\\n\\n## Results\\n\\n\\n\\n## Average Treatment Effects\\n\\n\\nFirst, we show, in the upper panel of Figure 2, the predicted mean support for tax decreases in three tax fields without a trade-off (control group) and the three different trade-offs (treatment groups) based on OLS regression analysis. To test the robustness of our findings, we also control for several covariates (e.g., age, sex, occupational classes, income, education, employment status, partisanship, parents with children) and include country-fixed effects.\\n\\nIn line with our expectations, citizens' support for tax cuts is dramatically reduced when confronted with the necessary real-world trade-offs (Hypothesis 1). While average support for a lower income tax and lower value added tax in unconstrained settings is around 6.5 (on a 0 to 10 scale), this declines well below 6.0 for both policies. In most cases, it declines by around 1.5 points to around 5.0. Support for a lower top income tax is already pretty unpopular in an\\n\\nunconstrained setting and does not decline when trade-offs are introduced. This is likely the result of a partial floor effect.\\n\\nFigure 2: Support for tax decreases by treatment and model, all countries pooled. Note: The upper panel shows predicted mean support and 95 percent confidence intervals based on OLS regressions (dependent variable is scaled from 0 to 10; covariates are age, gender, marital status, education, and income). The associated regression tables are shown in Appendix C. The lower panel shows the predicted share of respondents supporting tax decreases and 95 percent confidence intervals, where the dependent variable is dichotomized (6 to 10 support; 0 to 5 opposition/neutral).\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nTo estimate the share of people who support lower taxes, we dichotomized the dependent variable. Since we are interested in support for lower taxes, we use five as the cut-off point, i.e., responses from six to ten are counted as agreement, while responses from zero to five are counted as disagreement/neutral. The lower panel of Figure 2 shows that only about one-fifth of the respondents support lowering top income taxes. However, a sizable majority support lower income and value added taxes: 63 percent support lower income taxes; 67 percent support lower value added taxes. This support for tax cuts falls well below a 50 percent majority threshold once we introduce fiscal trade-offs. The only trade-off that still receives a slight majority is the one between lower income tax and lower spending.\\n\\nFigure A.7 in Appendix D.1 also points to a few interesting country differences. Whereas lowering top income taxes is similarly unpopular in all four countries, there are more substantial country differences for income taxes and value added taxes. Lowering these two taxes is most popular in Italy and least popular in the UK. Income taxes are so unpopular in Italy that even with the introduction of fiscal trade-offs a slight majority still favors cutting them. In the UK, where taxes are relatively low already compared to other European countries, there is always a majority against lower income taxes. Even though support for lower value added taxes is also exceptionally high in Italy, such support becomes a minority position in the face of fiscal trade-offs.\\n\\nOverall, our findings confirm that lower taxes are popular in the unconstrained setting. This popularity, however, decreases when trade-offs are introduced. This supports our first hypothesis, which states that support for lower taxes declines substantially once respondents are confronted with fiscal trade-offs. Top income taxes are an exception in this regard. Due to the already low support for lowering top income taxes in the control group, the introduction of fiscal trade-offs does not significantly reduce support levels further. Moreover, the most regressive changes to the tax system, i.e., all policies that lower top income taxes are the least popular, while more progressive changes enjoy more widespread support. The only exception here is the somewhat popular trade-off of cutting income taxes in exchange for lower government spending, which is expected to generate a regressive distributive effect.\\n\\n\\n## Heterogeneous Treatment Effects by Income and Ideology\\n\\n\\nFigure 3 and Figure 4 display the predicted support for lower taxes by fiscal trade-off for low- and high-income groups and for left- and right-wing respondents, both derived from OLS regressions with a basic set of covariates and country-fixed effects included. Since we are mainly interested in differences between low- and high-income and between right- and left-wing respondents, we do not show the results for the middle-income and the ideological center groups. However, the full results including those groups are presented in Figure A.4 and Figure A.5 in the Appendix.\\n\\nOverall, differences between income groups are more muted than between ideological groups. Nevertheless, low-income citizens are slightly more supportive of lowering the value added tax. From the standpoint of material self-interest, this makes a lot of sense, given the VAT's inherently regressive distributive nature. There are no discernible differences in support for lower general income taxes across income groups, which bolsters our argument that people have a neutral distributive tax in mind when assessing this vignette. Finally, we do not find any significant differences between low- and high-income respondents in their support for a lower top income tax. 6\\n\\nThe introduction of fiscal trade-offs substantially reduces support for lower taxes across all income groups for the VAT and income tax trade-offs, while support for lower top income taxes is not further reduced. 7 Differences between high- and low-income groups in the evaluation of fiscal trade-offs are surprisingly small and mostly insignificant. Nevertheless, there are some indications that high-income respondents are overall slightly more supportive of regressive fiscal trade-offs. For example, high-income citizens favor lowering the top income tax in exchange for a higher VAT. On the other hand, low-income citizens prioritize a lower VAT at the cost of lower government spending or higher government debt. Although we do not find evidence for Hypothesis 2 in all trade-off combinations, if there are significant differences, their direction thus follows the expected pattern.\\n\\nFigure 3: Predicted values by income groups.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nNote: The figure shows the predicted values by income groups based on OLS regressions. All regression models include covariates and country-fixed effects. The full regression table is shown in Appendix C.\\n\\nHowever, there are three potential explanations why income differences are smaller than expected. First, not all citizens are able to accurately gauge the distributive effects of fiscal trade-offs. Even though it is reassuring to see that our findings go in the expected theorized direction, we still need to know more about how citizens perceive the distributive effects of taxes and reason about them (for a notable expception, see Stantcheva, 2021). Second, there is some evidence that differences between income groups are more pronounced on the country-level and partially cancel each other out when we pool the four countries (see Figure A.8 in the Appendix). For example, low-income citizens are significantly more supportive of the progressive trade-off of reducing the VAT in exchange for higher income tax in Italy, Germany, and the UK, but they are against it in Spain. Finally, income groups have become ideologically more heterogeneous over time and thus income differences are more muted. We will return to this last point in the next section, where we interact income with ideology to study cross-pressured citizens.\\n\\nIn contrast to income, there are more substantial differences between left- and right-wing respondents (based on their self-identified position on a 0 to 10 left-right scale. Figure 4 shows\\n\\nFigure 4: Predicted values by ideology.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nthat right-wing respondents have a much higher support for lowering all three types of taxes in the control group. Thus, right-wing respondents favor lower income taxes, lower top income taxes, and lower VAT more strongly than those from the left. Ideological differences are largest for the progressive tax (top income tax), while differences for the regressive tax (VAT) are much smaller. This might also indicate that the VAT is not perceived or recognized as a regressive tax by many respondents.\\n\\nThese ideological differences between left- and right-wing respondents remain significant and substantial even after we introduce fiscal trade-offs. Overall, left-wing respondents are more strongly in favor of fiscal trade-offs that steer the tax system in a more progressive direction. Compared to left-wing respondents, right-wing respondents favor lower income taxes and lower top income taxes more strongly, even if it implies lower spending, higher government debt, or higher VAT. The ideological difference in support is particularly pronounced for one of the most regressive trade-offs, namely the reduction of the top income tax in exchange for lower\\n\\ngovernment spending. Left-wing respondents also prefer more strongly a decrease of the VAT in exchange for lower government spending or higher public debt.\\n\\nThus, in accordance with Hypothesis 3, respondents on the right have a lower priority for redistribution, while left-wing respondents are adamantly opposed to shifting fiscal policies in a more regressive direction. In contrast to income groups, there are little country-specific differences between the ideological groups (see Figure A.9 in the Appendix).\\n\\n\\n## Cross-Pressured Citizens by Income and Ideology\\n\\n\\nFinally, we want to focus on cross-pressured citizens, particularly left-leaning, high-income and right-leaning, low-income respondents and how they assess fiscal trade-offs. Figure 5 shows the predicted support for lower taxes based on OLS regressions including a three-way interaction (treatment*income*ideology), socio-economic covariates (age, sex, marital status), and countryfixed effects.\\n\\nThe upper left panel shows that in the control group, the income gradient for supporting lower income tax is more important among left-wing than right-wing respondents. In other words, expected support for a lower income tax drops more sharply among left-wing respondents than among right-wing respondents as income levels increase. We observe a similar interaction effect between ideology and income when it comes to lower top income taxes and lower VAT. This is particularly pronounced in the case of top income taxes. At low income levels, leftand right-wing respondents show remarkably similar levels of support for a lower top income tax. When income starts to increase, support for a lower top income tax increases among right-wing respondents but decreases among left-wing respondents. This broadly corresponds with findings from Armingeon and Weisstanner (2021), who show that support for redistribution declines drastically among non-left citizens with increasing income levels. Still, it is noteworthy that left-wing respondents with lower incomes prefer lower top income taxes far more than those with higher incomes, which goes against the premise of material self-interest.\\n\\nBut how do cross-pressured groups evaluate fiscal trade-offs? When we look at regressive trade-offs between lowering general income tax in exchange for higher VAT or lower government spending, we see an even more apparent differentiation. Right- and left-wing respondents differ\\n\\nFigure 5: Predicted support for lower taxes by income and ideology groups. Note: The figure shows predicted support for lower taxes based on OLS regression with a three-way interaction (treatment * income * ideology), a set of covariates (age, sex, marital status), and country-fixed effects.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nmore in their trade-off assessments at higher income levels, with the latter being more strongly opposed to fiscal policy measures that have a clearly regressive distributive impact. Even though they still follow the expected pattern, the interaction effects are less pronounced for lowering top income tax in exchange for a higher VAT or higher government debt. However, contrary to our expectations, we do not find any relevant interaction effects for the trade-offs associated with a lower VAT.\\n\\nOverall, we find evidence in line with our fourth hypothesis, which states that the effect of income on the priority for redistribution is weaker among left-wing than among right-wing\\n\\nrespondents. Our findings indicate that there are significant differences between left- and rightwing respondents at higher income levels. This is not just because right-wing, high-income citizens pursue their material self-interest more fervently, but also results from the remarkable finding that high-income, left-wing respondents are even more supportive of a progressive fiscal design than low-income, left-wing respondents.\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\n\\nIn the advanced economies, taxes are the most important source of revenue for states. They are used to fund a large amount of government spending, which citizens cherish. Still, taxation is first and foremost a cost for individuals, who are thus said to favor lower taxes. We presented evidence that, indeed, support for tax cuts is relatively widespread if people are presented with unconstrained survey questions. However, once we account for fiscal trade-offs, support for lower taxes drops substantially.\\n\\nThis suggests that tax cuts are often not a priority for voters. As many citizens also support higher government spending and lower government debt, some of them inevitably place less importance on taxes if they (are forced to) internalize the fiscal trade-offs between conflicting aims. Our results further show that the specific tax design also matter. Shifting the tax system in a more regressive direction is much less popular, while more progressive changes enjoy more widespread support.\\n\\nOn the individual level, our findings indicate that preferences and priorities are shaped by As expected, people with a higher income and more rightwing political attitudes are more likely to favor tax cuts, in particular those that are regressive.\\n\\nmaterial self-interest and ideology. In contrast, people who have lower incomes and are more left-wing, are more likely to favor progressive policy changes. Even though income differences are much smaller than ideological differences in the evaluation of fiscal trade-offs, we find that there is an important interaction between income and ideology: when citizens are cross-pressured by material self-interest and ideology, the latter dominates. Most importantly, high-income voters that are left-wing do not strongly support tax cuts when fiscal trade-offs are acknowledged. In fact, they are even more likely to oppose these tax cuts than low-income voters (irrespective of ideology). It is,\\n\\ntherefore, mainly right-wing individuals that support lower taxes at all costs, which opens up the possibility of a progressive coalition against tax cuts, which includes all low-income citizens and the high-income left.\\n\\nFuture research should take up these findings and ask whether this progressive coalition is also possible when it comes to tax increases. In this paper, we focused on public opinion towards tax cuts because existing research suggests that voters in advanced economies favor lower taxes (Berens and Gelepithis, 2021), and it was our aim to test how strong this support is in the face of fiscal trade-offs among different respondents. Yet, initiatives to tackle some of the largest challenges of the twenty-first century, including the green transition and attempts to reduce economic inequality, will depend on states' ability to raise additional resources. It is thus important to ask whether governments can generate sufficient public support to achieve this.\\n\\nStill, our findings are already important for several reasons: First, in line with existing work, our results show that more progressive changes to the tax systems are more popular than regressive changes (Ballard-Rosa et al., 2017; Barnes, 2015). Yet, in contrast to this work and a lot of other research on public opinion regarding taxation (summarized by Berens and Gelepithis, 2021), we emphasize that the modal respondent does not necessarily support tax cuts when forced to internalize the associated trade-offs (Barnes et al., 2022), i.e., support for lower taxes is not unconditional. Given that public opinion on fiscal policies strongly responds to elite framing (Barnes and Hicks, 2018; Bisgaard and Slothuus, 2018), political actors opposed to tax cuts could generate majority support for their cause by emphasizing these trade-offs.\\n\\nSecond, the fact that a progressive coalition consisting of low-income voters and the highincome left is possible when it comes to taxes, is good news for the center-left. Many social democratic parties have struggled with the prospect of electoral decline in the last few years. As structural changes have reduced the size of the working-class and political conflicts have arisen that are not classical bread-and-butter economic issues (e.g., migration, climate change, gender equality), it has become increasingly difficult for them to put together a winning coalition of working- and middle-class voters. However, our results suggest that these voters can still see eye-to-eye on important political questions such as taxation. This presents an opening for them to re-build electoral alliances, even if only to form governing coalitions with other parties (e.g., the Greens).\\n\\n\",\n          \"## 1 Introduction\\n\\n\\nUnderstanding the formation of human social structures requires a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates insights from anthropology, psychology, sociology, neurobiology, and evolutionary biology. Traditional narratives often emphasize cooperation, mutual aid, and collective survival as primary drivers of social structure formation. [1] However, other theories suggest that various factors, including sexual dynamics, resource allocation, environmental pressures, and neurobiological drivers, significantly influenced the development of early human societies. [2] [3]\\n\\nThis paper hypothesizes that human social structures emerged from a complex interplay of these factors, where sexual dynamics and neurobiological motivations played crucial roles alongside cooperation and environmental adaptation. By integrating quantitative analyses and interdisciplinary research, the paper aims to provide a nuanced understanding of how early human behaviors and societal norms developed.\\n\\nThe objectives of this paper are:\\n\\n- \\u00b7 To enhance methodological rigor by providing empirical data and statistical analyses.\\n- \\u00b7 To incorporate supporting hypotheses from interdisciplinary research for each aspect of social structure formation.\\n- \\u00b7 To examine the role of neurobiological drivers, particularly dopamine, in influencing early human behavior.\\n- \\u00b7 To analyze cross-cultural variations in social structures and gender roles.\\n- \\u00b7 To provide a chronological analysis of current data on reported cases of abuse, correlating abusive behavior with law enforcement statistics through a mathematical model.\\n- \\u00b7 To address previous critiques by considering diverse cultural contexts and providing historical nuance.\\n\\n\\n## 2 Methodological Rigor and Quantitative Analysis\\n\\n\\nA rigorous methodological approach is essential for examining the complex factors that influenced the formation of human social structures. This section utilizes quantitative analyses to assess population growth, reproductive strategies, and the statistical probability of certain behaviors.\\n\\n\\n## 2.1 Population Growth and Reproductive Strategies\\n\\n\\nHypothesis: High fertility rates and specific reproductive strategies were essential for the survival and growth of early human populations due to high mortality rates.\\n\\nEmpirical data suggest that early human populations faced significant mortality rates, particularly among infants and young children. [4] Archaeological evidence from huntergatherer societies indicates child mortality rates ranging from 30% to 50%. [5]\\n\\nTo sustain population numbers, it was necessary for women to have multiple offspring. Demographic models show that with a child mortality rate of approximately 50%, a total fertility rate (TFR) of around 6 to 8 children per woman was required for population replacement. [4]\\n\\nInterdisciplinary research from evolutionary biology supports the hypothesis that reproductive strategies, such as cooperative breeding and alloparenting, evolved to enhance offspring survival. [6] These strategies necessitated social structures that supported childrearing and resource allocation.\\n\\n\\n## 2.2 Statistical Probability of Inbreeding and Early Sexual Activity\\n\\n\\nHypothesis: In small, isolated populations, the increased probability of inbreeding was a byproduct of limited mate availability rather than deliberate strategies.\\n\\nGenetic studies show that in populations with fewer than 500 individuals, the effective population size leads to higher levels of homozygosity and increased inbreeding coefficients. [7] Anthropological evidence suggests that early humans developed social norms and taboos against incest to mitigate the negative consequences of inbreeding. [8]\\n\\nPsychological research indicates that the Westermarck effect, an innate aversion to sexual attraction among individuals raised in close proximity, may have evolved as a natural mechanism to prevent incest. [9] This is supported by cross-cultural studies showing that incest taboos are nearly universal, suggesting an evolutionary basis. [10]\\n\\n\\n## 2.3 Enhanced Methodological Approach\\n\\n\\nTo enhance methodological rigor, key variables are clearly defined:\\n\\n- \\u00b7 P : Population size, derived from archaeological and genetic data.\\n- \\u00b7 TFR : Total fertility rate, obtained from demographic studies.\\n- \\u00b7 Inbreeding coefficient ( F ): Calculated using population genetics formulas.\\n- \\u00b7 Mortality rates ( M ): Sourced from anthropological records.\\n\\nStatistical analyses are conducted using real-world data where available, and models are validated against empirical observations.\\n\\n\\n## 3 Integration of Interdisciplinary Research\\n\\n\\n\\n## 3.1 Neurobiological Drivers: The Role of Dopamine in Early Human Behavior\\n\\n\\nHypothesis: Dopamine, as a primary neurotransmitter associated with reward and motivation, significantly influenced early human survival strategies and social behaviors.\\n\\nNeurobiological research demonstrates that dopamine pathways in the brain are critical for reinforcing behaviors essential for survival, such as obtaining food and engaging in reproductive activities. [11] In early human societies, dopamine-driven reward mechanisms would have motivated individuals to pursue activities that increased their chances of survival and reproductive success.\\n\\nInterdisciplinary studies in evolutionary psychology suggest that dopamine's role in reward processing influenced social bonding, mating behaviors, and risk-taking. [12] For example, dopamine-related behaviors could have led to increased exploration and resource acquisition, essential for survival in changing environments.\\n\\n\\n## 3.2 Psychological and Sociological Insights\\n\\n\\nPsychological studies on motivation and reward systems highlight how dopamine influences decision-making and social interactions. [13] Sociological theories on power structures and gender roles provide context for understanding how dominance behaviors may have developed and been reinforced within societies. [14]\\n\\n\\n## 3.3 Alternative Neurobiological Factors\\n\\n\\nWhile dopamine plays a significant role, other neurotransmitters like oxytocin and serotonin also impact social bonding and mood regulation. [15] Oxytocin is associated with trust and attachment, influencing cooperative behaviors and social cohesion. [16]\\n\\n\\n## 4 Empirical Data and Case Studies\\n\\n\\n\\n## 4.1 Anthropological Case Studies\\n\\n\\nStudies on the impact of legal reforms in Scandinavian countries demonstrate a correlation between stricter enforcement and reduced domestic violence rates. [17] For instance, Sweden's implementation of progressive gender equality policies and strong legal protections has been associated with decreased rates of intimate partner violence.\\n\\n\\n## 4.2 Statistical Analysis of Genetic Data\\n\\n\\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified variations in dopamine receptor genes (e.g., DRD4) that are associated with differences in social behaviors across populations. [18] Statistical analyses using regression models can quantify the relationship between these genetic variations and societal structures.\\n\\n\\n## 4.3 Longitudinal Studies on Societal Norms\\n\\n\\nAnalyzing data from longitudinal studies, such as those conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), reveals trends in abuse reporting correlated with educational campaigns and shifts in societal attitudes. [19] Increased societal awareness ( S ) has been linked to higher reporting rates ( r ) and decreased dark number coefficients ( d ).\\n\\n\\n## 5 Mathematical Model and Statistical Validation\\n\\n\\n\\n## 5.1 Refined Mathematical Model\\n\\n\\nThe mathematical model is refined with clear definitions:\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\\n\\nWhere:\\n\\n- \\u00b7 A : Actual number of abuse cases.\\n- \\u00b7 P : Population size.\\n- \\u00b7 r : Reported cases per capita.\\n- \\u00b7 d : Estimated unreported cases per capita (dark number coefficient).\\n- \\u00b7 k : Constant representing baseline prevalence.\\n- \\u00b7 E : Effectiveness of law enforcement (e.g., conviction rates, legal resource allocation).\\n- \\u00b7 S : Societal awareness and acceptance (e.g., education levels, public opinion surveys).\\n\\n\\n## 5.2 Statistical Validation Using Regression Analysis\\n\\n\\nAdvanced statistical methods, such as multiple regression analysis, are employed to validate the model with real-world data. By inputting data from various countries with differing E and S values, we can assess the model's predictive accuracy.\\n\\n\\n## 6 Testable Predictions and Hypotheses\\n\\n\\n\\n## 6.1 Prediction 1: Impact of Law Enforcement Effectiveness\\n\\n\\nHypothesis: An increase in the effectiveness of law enforcement ( E ) will lead to a measurable decrease in the dark number coefficient ( d ).\\n\\n- \\u00b7 Testable Prediction: Countries that implement reforms to improve law enforcement effectiveness will observe a reduction in unreported abuse cases over time.\\n\\n\\n## 6.2 Prediction 2: Genetic Correlations with Social Behavior\\n\\n\\nHypothesis: Populations with higher prevalence of certain dopamine receptor genes associated with reward-seeking behavior will exhibit social structures reflecting higher competitiveness.\\n\\n- \\u00b7 Testable Prediction: Genetic studies will show correlations between DRD4 gene variants and societal measures of competitiveness and individualism.\\n\\n\\n## 6.3 Prediction 3: Influence of Societal Awareness\\n\\n\\nHypothesis: Educational interventions that enhance societal awareness ( S ) will correlate with increased reporting rates ( r ) and decreased unreported cases ( d ).\\n\\n- \\u00b7 Testable Prediction: Implementation of nationwide awareness campaigns will result in higher rates of abuse reporting and lower estimates of unreported cases.\\n\\n\\n## 7 Consideration of Confounding Variables\\n\\n\\n\\n## 7.1 Economic Conditions\\n\\n\\nEconomic instability or poverty may affect both abuse rates and reporting practices. [20] To control for this, economic indicators such as GDP per capita are included in the regression model as covariates.\\n\\n\\n## 7.2 Political Stability\\n\\n\\nRegions with political turmoil may have compromised law enforcement effectiveness. Political stability indices are incorporated into the analysis to account for this variable.\\n\\n\\n## 7.3 Technological Access\\n\\n\\nAccess to communication technologies can influence reporting rates and societal awareness. [21] Internet penetration rates and mobile phone usage statistics are used as proxies for technological access.\\n\\n\\n## 8 Expanding the Theoretical Framework\\n\\n\\n\\n## 8.1 Evolutionary Psychology\\n\\n\\nIntegrate theories on mate selection and social behavior, such as sexual selection theory, to explain dominance behaviors. [22]\\n\\n\\n## 8.2 Social Learning Theory\\n\\n\\nExplore how behaviors and norms are transmitted across generations through observation and imitation. [23] Cultural practices may reinforce or challenge dominance structures.\\n\\n\\n## 8.3 Technological Influence\\n\\n\\nConsider the role of technological advancements in shaping social structures, communication, and awareness. [24] The rise of social media has impacted societal awareness ( S ) and reporting behaviors ( r ).\\n\\n\\n## 9 Conclusion\\n\\n\\nThis paper has applied a rigorous empirical and methodological approach to examine the persistence of sexual dominance throughout human history. By integrating quantitative analyses with interdisciplinary research across anthropology, evolutionary biology, sociology, and neurobiology, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of how sexual dynamics have consistently shaped human social structures.\\n\\nThe empirical data, including population growth models, reproductive strategies, and the statistical probability of behaviors such as inbreeding, offer insight into the evolutionary drivers behind the formation of patriarchal systems. Genetic data on dopamine receptor variations, combined with neurobiological studies on reward mechanisms, demonstrate how neurochemical influences have reinforced dominance behaviors, particularly in male-female power dynamics.\\n\\nThe mathematical models developed in this research, such as the regression analysis of societal awareness and law enforcement effectiveness on the prevalence of abuse, provide strong empirical support for the correlation between social control mechanisms and the persistence of sexual dominance. These models underscore the role of law enforcement and societal awareness in mitigating or perpetuating these power imbalances, offering quantifiable evidence of the relationship between gender-based violence and structural patriarchy.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [1] Diamond, Jared M.

We develop a model to evaluate which calls could be transitioned to civilian responders based on their crime risk. We use a rich dataset of community-initiated emergency calls to Baltimore Police Department to evaluate the effect of re-tasking based on three call diversion design scenarios. We find that 22 to 57 percent of 911 calls could be assigned to civilians. We then apply Monte Carlo methods to estimate the financial and time use implications of transferring low risk calls to civilians. Under the most conservative scenario, re-tasking frees police officer time equivalent to 59 additional full-time officers (95% CI: 43 \\u2013 75 officers), about nine percent of the Department\\u2019s current patrol personnel.\",\n          \"It is commonly assumed that voters favor lower taxes, which undermines the ability of governments to raise revenues. How does the demand for lower taxes change when it involves fiscal trade-offs? Who supports tax cuts at all costs? We use a survey experiment conducted in four European countries (Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK) to answer these questions, studying preferences on income taxes, value added taxes (VAT), and top income taxes. The results show that support for income tax and VAT cuts drops profoundly when it implies lower government spending or higher government debt. Lower top income taxes are always unpopular. Both interest and ideology influence preferences, but for cross-pressured people, ideology dominates: high-income voters that are left-wing oppose tax cuts. The results are important because they suggest that a progressive coalition against lower taxes \\u2013 including low-income voters and the high-income left \\u2013 is possible.\",\n          \"This paper re-examines the foundations of human social structures by integrating\\nempirical data, advanced statistical analyses, and interdisciplinary research from an-\\nthropology, psychology, sociology, neurobiology, and evolutionary biology.
